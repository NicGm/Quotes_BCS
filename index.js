`"Saul Goodman is… He’s the last line of defense for the little guy. Are you getting sold down the river? He’s a life raft. You getting stepped on, he’s a sharp stick. You got Goliath on your back, Saul’s the guy with the slingshot. He’s a righter of wrongs. He’s friend to the friendless. That’s Saul Goodman."
-Jimmy McGill, S5.Ep4: Namaste`,
`"You know why God made snakes before he made lawyers? He needed the practice."
